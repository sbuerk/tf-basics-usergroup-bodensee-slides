# TYPO3 Basics - testing-framework integration

## Introduction

This repository contains the slides for the session/talk hold for the TYPO3 UserGroup Bodensee 
at `2024-06-05 19:30 CEST` by Stefan BÃ¼rk.

In addition to the talk itself two dedicated demonstration and playground has been created:

* [TYPO3 Basics - demo project and playground](https://github.com/sbuerk/tf-basics-project)
* [TYPO3 Basics - demo extension and playground](https://github.com/sbuerk/tf-basics-extension)

Both repositories include a `README.md` with basic steps using the easy to use [ddev environment](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
local development environment and additional some basic `ddev commands`, `Makefile` and a basic
`Build/Scripts/runTests.sh` example as kickstart for further play-rounds and testing stuff out.

The slides are presented using [presenterm](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm) with the `kitty terminal`.
